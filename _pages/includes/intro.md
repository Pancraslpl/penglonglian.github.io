I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), advised by Prof. XXX. My research focuses on intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under non-ideal conditions, including open-set fault diagnosis, continual domain adaptation, small-sample learning, and cross-modal fault diagnosis.

I received my M.Sc. degree in Control Engineering from Xiâ€™an University of Technology, and my B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Northwest Minzu University. I have collaborated with leading research institutes and industry partners such as Dongfang Electric and the China Academy of Engineering Physics, working on projects involving hydropower units, turbine DEH systems, embedded sensing modules, and UAV swarm communication fault diagnosis.

I have published papers in international journals and conferences, including Advanced Engineering Informatics, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, Control Engineering Practice, and IEEE conferences. My honors include First-class/Second-class Scholarships (top-tier awards), Excellent Thesis Awards (Bachelor & Master), and consecutive recognition as an Excellent Teaching Assistant.

I am open to academic collaborations in intelligent fault diagnosis, prognostics and health management (PHM), and data-driven reliability engineering. Please feel free to contact me at lianpenglong@163.com
